Notes / Warnings  
================  
Mod will spawn a "hunter fleet" on key press, using the same function the game uses to spawn these fleets in.  
  
This works INDEPDENTLY from the existing game timer.  You will end up with 2 fleets if you manually spawn a fleet, then the game spawns a fleet on its timer.  
  
The fleet will be whichever faction owns the sector you are currently in (I haven't tried it in a "no owner" sector, it might crash or you might get a fleet of marauders, I don't know...).  You can therefore spawn a friendly "hunter fleet".  As with most ships, these will despawn once you leave the sector, but just be aware (note: this can be fun when combined with attack fleets, just sayin'...).  
  
Always backup your save game before installing any mod.  
  
If you encounter any bug when you have a mode loaded, uninstall the mod first.  If you can replicate the issue without any mods installed, then consider reporting it on official discord / forums.  
  
Mod bugs are my problem :D.
